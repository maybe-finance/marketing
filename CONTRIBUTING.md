# Contributing to Maybe

It means so much that you're interested in contributing to Maybe! Seriously. Thank you. The entire community benefits from these contributions!

## House Rules

- Before contributing, please check if it already exists in [issues](https://github.com/maybe-finance/marketing/issues) or [PRs](https://github.com/maybe-finance/marketing/pulls)
- Given the speed at which we're moving on the codebase, we don't assign issues or "give" issues to anyone.
- When multiple PRs are submitted for the same issue, we take the one that most succinctly & efficiently solves a given problem and stays within the scope of work.
- Priority is generally given to previous committers as they've proven familiarity with the codebase and product.

## Development

### Setup

To get setup for local development, we recommend using [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) with VSCode (see the `.devcontainer` folder).

### Making a Pull Request

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request, and be sure to check the [Allow edits from maintainers](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) option while creating your PR. This allows maintainers to collaborate with you on your PR if needed.
6. If possible, [link your pull request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) by adding the appropriate keyword (e.g. `fixes issue #XXX`)
7. Before requesting a review, please make sure that all [Github Checks](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/checks?apiVersion=2022-11-28) have passed and your branch is up-to-date with the `main` branch. After doing so, request a review and wait for a maintainer's approval.

All PRs should target the `main` branch.

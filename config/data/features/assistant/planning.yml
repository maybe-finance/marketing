          - "Right now, your schedule is optimized for income generation—you're trading ~50 hours/week for earnings that support a 21% savings rate. But if you reduced work to 35–40 hours and accepted a 10–15% income drop, you'd still cover all core expenses and maintain a 15% savings rate, while gaining ~40 extra hours per month of free time."
